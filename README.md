# clean-architecture-cpp

An evolving C++ playground focused on clean architectural thinking.

This repository contains small, dependency-free utilities and experimental
building blocks developed with long-term architectural clarity in mind.

It is intentionally minimal at the moment and will grow over time.


## Current State

The repository currently includes:

- simple string utilities
- lightweight parsing helpers
- small conversion functions

These components are deliberately small and focused.

More advanced abstractions will be introduced incrementally.


## Design Philosophy

- Clarity over cleverness
- Explicit over implicit
- Deterministic behavior
- No hidden global state
- Architecture before optimization

This is a long-term architectural exploration rather than a finished framework.


## Build

C++11 compatible.
